## Description

Many existing boilerplate are to complex for begginers, for example incorporate yml configuration files for CI's as travis o circle, a deployment site as netifly or heroku, CLI for scaffolding and so on... The idea is to keep this boilerplate very simple only using node js and react packages with the standar tooling you can find in many projects as eslint, prettier, jest etc...

The idea is to use it to write posts or make videos to show how to improve this project, how to deploy it in any provider, how to create login with many platforms an so on.
